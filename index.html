        <hr>
        <p class="special_para">Plants and trees are considered to be the rescuers of the nature. If we wouldn’t save them, our next generation will have to pay for it. So, just take care of them, they’ll take care of you. A study shows that having trees in your neighborhood will keep you away from many mental and physical diseases. They’ll have a very stimulating impact.</p>  
        <p id="this_one_is_special">Trees are controllers of global warming:

Global warming has become hot topic of the day. Earth’s temperature is increasing day by day which is triggering many issues regarding health, nature conservation, ecosystem and many others. One of the major reasons of this issue is the cutting of trees. Trees act as absorbs for dangerous ultraviolet and greenhouse gases. They contribute a lot in reducing environmental temperature by acting as natural air conditioners and a source of rain. Consequently,they are one of the major controllers of global warming. So,                                                                                                                                                             “Save trees now, they will save you in future.”.</p>
